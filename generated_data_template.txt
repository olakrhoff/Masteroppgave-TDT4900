This is a template for how the generated data will be formatted.
Also we will discuss a bit how this data generation has been done.

We might want to classify a few different datasets.
    * A dataset where the majority of the agents have a concencus on the goods (ranking)
    * A dataset where there are many different skewed valuations of the goods (very subjective)
    * We might want a dataset where we have a more uniform distribution of value
